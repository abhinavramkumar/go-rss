When building an initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an RSS Reader, it's important to focus on the core features that provide value to users. Here are the most important features to consider for an initial MVP:

1. User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and authenticate themselves to access personalized features and manage their subscriptions.

2. RSS Feed Subscription: Enable users to subscribe to RSS feeds by providing the URL of the feed or by browsing and selecting feeds from a predefined list. Implement functionality to fetch and display the latest articles from subscribed feeds.

3. Feed Management: Provide users with the ability to add, edit, and remove their subscribed feeds. Allow them to organize feeds into folders or categories for better content organization.

4. Read and Mark as Read: Implement a user-friendly interface to display articles from subscribed feeds. Users should be able to mark articles as read or unread, indicating their progress in consuming the content.

5. Content Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter articles based on various criteria, such as unread articles, specific categories, or keywords. Implement sorting options, such as sorting by date, title, or source, to help users find relevant content quickly.

6. Search Functionality: Enable users to search for articles within their subscribed feeds. Implement a search bar that allows users to enter keywords and displays matching articles.

7. Offline Reading: Provide users with the ability to save articles for offline reading. Implement caching mechanisms to store articles locally on the device, ensuring they are accessible even without an internet connection.

8. Notifications and Alerts: Notify users about new articles or updates from their subscribed feeds. Implement push notifications or email alerts to keep users informed about fresh content.

9. Responsive Design: Ensure the RSS Reader is responsive and works well across different devices and screen sizes. The user interface should adapt and provide a seamless experience on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.

10. User Interface and Design: Focus on creating a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface. Use modern design principles, typography, and appropriate color schemes to enhance readability and user experience.

11. Performance Optimization: Pay attention to performance optimization techniques to ensure fast loading times and smooth navigation within the application. Implement lazy loading of articles or pagination to enhance performance when dealing with a large number of articles.

12. Error Handling and Feedback: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to display meaningful error messages to users in case of any issues, such as invalid feed URLs or connectivity problems. Provide a way for users to provide feedback or report issues within the application.

Remember, the purpose of an MVP is to deliver a functional product with the core features that provide value to users. Focus on building these essential features first and iterate based on user feedback and market demand.
